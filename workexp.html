                        trained to run the self-checkout machines and taught many others to be good cashiers before getting moved to lots of different 
                        departments for additional experience. I learned how to work in the Frozen, Dairy, Produce, and Grocery departments before 
                        turning 18. When I turned 18, I chose to become a Customer Service Specialist and manage the front end of the store.</p>
